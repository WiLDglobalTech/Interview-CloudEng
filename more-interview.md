9. **What is Amazon S3 bucket versioning and how does it work?**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

Amazon S3 bucket versioning is a feature that keeps multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. It provides the following capabilities:

1. Preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket
2. Recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite

How it works:
- When enabled, versioning stores all versions of an object, including all writes and deletes
- Each version is given a unique version ID
- The latest version is always returned when requesting an object, unless a specific version is requested
- Deleting an object doesn't remove it permanently, but adds a delete marker
- Previous versions can be restored by deleting the delete marker

Benefits:
- Data protection against accidental deletions or overwrites
- Data retention for compliance requirements
- Ability to retrieve and restore previous versions of objects

Note that enabling versioning will increase storage costs as you're storing multiple copies of objects.

</details>

10. **Explain the difference between stateless and stateful firewalls in AWS.**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

In AWS, stateless and stateful firewalls are implemented through Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and Security Groups, respectively.

Stateless Firewall (NACL):
- Operates at the subnet level
- Evaluates each packet in isolation, without considering the packet's relationship to previous traffic
- Rules are processed in order, with the lowest numbered rule taking precedence
- Must specify both inbound and outbound rules explicitly
- Can explicitly allow and deny traffic

Stateful Firewall (Security Group):
- Operates at the instance level
- Maintains awareness of the state of network connections
- Automatically allows return traffic for allowed inbound traffic
- All rules are evaluated before deciding whether to allow traffic
- Can only allow traffic; implicit deny for anything not explicitly allowed
- Remembers previous decisions for a period of time

In general, Security Groups are easier to manage and are sufficient for most use cases, while NACLs provide an additional layer of security when needed.

17. **What is Amazon SNS and how does it differ from Amazon SQS?**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) and Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) are both messaging services in AWS, but they serve different purposes:

Amazon SNS:
- Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) messaging service
- Pushes messages to multiple subscribers
- Supports multiple protocols (HTTP/S, email, SMS, mobile push notifications)
- Ideal for broadcasting messages to multiple recipients
- Supports fanout architecture where a message is sent to multiple SQS queues

Amazon SQS:
- Fully managed message queuing service
- Messages are pulled by consumers
- Supports standard queues (at-least-once delivery) and FIFO queues (exactly-once processing)
- Ideal for decoupling application components and implementing asynchronous workflows
- Supports long polling to reduce costs and latency

Key differences:
1. Push vs. Pull: SNS pushes messages, SQS requires consumers to pull messages
2. Persistence: SQS stores messages until consumed, SNS is not persistent (though it can retry deliveries)
3. Consumers: SNS supports multiple subscribers, SQS typically has a single consumer per queue
4. Use case: SNS is for broadcasting, SQS is for decoupling and buffering

Often, SNS and SQS are used together in distributed systems to create powerful, event-driven architectures.
