Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Key features include:

- Scalability: Easily scale up or down based on computing requirements
- Flexibility: Choose from various instance types optimized for different use cases
- Cost-effective: Pay only for the compute capacity you use
- Security: Integrated with Amazon VPC for network isolation
- Elasticity: Automatically increase or decrease capacity based on conditions you define
- Reliability: Spread instances across multiple Availability Zones for high availability

Amazon S3 offers several storage classes optimized for different use cases:

1. S3 Standard: For frequently accessed data
2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between two access tiers based on changing access patterns
3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): For long-lived, but less frequently accessed data
4. S3 One Zone-IA: Similar to Standard-IA, but stores data in a single AZ
5. S3 Glacier: Low-cost storage class for data archiving
6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest-cost storage class for long-term retention

The main differences are in availability, durability, retrieval times, and cost.

3. **What is AWS Lambda and how does it work?**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. Here's how it works:

1. You upload your code to Lambda
2. You set up your code to trigger from other AWS services, HTTP endpoints, or mobile apps
3. Lambda runs your code only when triggered, using only the compute resources needed
4. You pay only for the compute time you use

Key features:
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Automatic scaling
- Integrates with many AWS services
- Built-in fault tolerance
- Pay-per-use pricing model

</details>

4. **Describe the components of Amazon VPC and their purposes.**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) components include:

1. Subnet: A range of IP addresses in your VPC
2. Route Table: Contains rules to determine where network traffic is directed
3. Internet Gateway: Allows communication between VPC and the Internet
4. NAT Gateway: Allows private subnet resources to access the Internet
5. Security Group: Acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances
6. Network ACL: Acts as a firewall for associated subnets
7. VPC Peering: Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route
8. VPN Connection: Connects your VPC to your on-premises network
9. Elastic IP: A static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing

These components work together to create a secure and isolated network environment in the cloud.

5. **What is Amazon CloudFront and what are its benefits?**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. Benefits include:

1. Improved Performance: Delivers content from edge locations closest to the user
2. Security: Integrates with AWS Shield for DDoS protection
3. Programmability: Supports serverless computing with Lambda@Edge
4. Cost-effective: Pay only for the content you deliver through the network
5. Easy to use: Can be set up in minutes and easily integrated with other AWS services
6. Global Reach: Utilizes a worldwide network of edge locations
7. Deep integration with AWS: Works seamlessly with services like S3, EC2, ELB, and Route 53

</details>

6. **Explain the concept of Auto Scaling in AWS.**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

Auto Scaling in AWS is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in a group based on application demand. Key aspects include:

1. Scaling Policies: Define how to scale (e.g., based on CPU utilization, network traffic)
2. Launch Configuration/Template: Specifies the EC2 instance configuration for the group
3. Auto Scaling Group: Defines the minimum, maximum, and desired capacity of instances
4. Cooldown Period: Prevents Auto Scaling from launching or terminating additional instances before previous scaling activity takes effect
5. Health Checks: Ensures that instances in the group are healthy

Benefits:
- Better fault tolerance
- Improved availability
- Cost optimization
- Better user experience during traffic spikes

</details>

7. **What is Amazon RDS and what database engines does it support?**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed database service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports the following database engines:

1. Amazon Aurora (MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible)
2. MySQL
3. MariaDB
4. PostgreSQL
5. Oracle
6. Microsoft SQL Server

Key features of RDS:
- Automated patching
- Backups and restore
- Monitoring and metrics
- Multi-AZ deployments for high availability
- Read replicas for improved read performance
- Encryption at rest and in transit

</details>

8. **Describe the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines the distribution of responsibilities between AWS and the customer for security and compliance.

AWS responsibilities ("Security of the Cloud"):
- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and software infrastructure
- Network infrastructure
- Virtualization infrastructure

Customer responsibilities ("Security in the Cloud"):
- Data encryption
- Platform, applications, identity and access management
- Operating system configuration
- Network and firewall configuration
- Client-side data encryption and data integrity authentication
- Server-side encryption (file system and/or data)

The specific responsibilities vary depending on the services used. For example, for EC2, customers are responsible for guest OS patching, while for managed services like RDS, AWS handles this.

</details>

9. **What is Amazon S3 bucket versioning and how does it work?**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

Amazon S3 bucket versioning is a feature that keeps multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. It provides the following capabilities:

1. Preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket
2. Recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite

How it works:
- When enabled, versioning stores all versions of an object, including all writes and deletes
- Each version is given a unique version ID
- The latest version is always returned when requesting an object, unless a specific version is requested
- Deleting an object doesn't remove it permanently, but adds a delete marker
- Previous versions can be restored by deleting the delete marker

Benefits:
- Data protection against accidental deletions or overwrites
- Data retention for compliance requirements
- Ability to retrieve and restore previous versions of objects

Note that enabling versioning will increase storage costs as you're storing multiple copies of objects.

10. **Explain the difference between stateless and stateful firewalls in AWS.**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand answer</summary>

In AWS, stateless and stateful firewalls are implemented through Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and Security Groups, respectively.

Stateless Firewall (NACL):
- Operates at the subnet level
- Evaluates each packet in isolation, without considering the packet's relationship to previous traffic
- Rules are processed in order, with the lowest numbered rule taking precedence
- Must specify both inbound and outbound rules explicitly
- Can explicitly allow and deny traffic

Stateful Firewall (Security Group):
- Operates at the instance level
- Maintains awareness of the state of network connections
- Automatically allows return traffic for allowed inbound traffic
- All rules are evaluated before deciding whether to allow traffic
- Can only allow traffic; implicit deny for anything not explicitly allowed
- Remembers previous decisions for a period of time

In general, Security Groups are easier to manage and are sufficient for most use cases, while NACLs provide an additional layer of security when needed.
